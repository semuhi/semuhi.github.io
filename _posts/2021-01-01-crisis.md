This course aims to provide an overview of critical conversations about the political economy of financial crisis. Following an introduction to the history of global economic crises and different ways of measuring and conceptualizing economic crises, the course will investigate the following key questions: How do economic crises impact political participation, voting behavior, and trust in institutions? Do crises lead to the rise of populist-authoritarian governments with increasing support for extremist parties? What kind of communication strategies do politicians employ to reduce the political cost of bailouts and economic recovery programs? How does a crisis impact public support for economic redistribution? Do global explanations work for the Global South? Do economic crises lead to democratization? The primary learning outcome of this course is to expose students to timely and critical conversations about the political impact of financial crises.
