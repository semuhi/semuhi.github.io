I'm a PhD candidate in Political Science at the University of Toronto. I'm originally from Turkey. 

My dissertation research is on the authoritarian political control of the business elite through repression and cooptation. I’m also interested in how autocrats use polarization as an electoral strategy. I employ quantitative, computational, and experimental methods for my academic research. My co-authored papers are published on high-impact academic journals such as <a href="https://jcp.gc.cuny.edu"> Comparative Politics </a> and [Sociological Methods & Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/smr). 

I’m the co‑founder of a Toronto‑based political risk consultancy company that leverages social media data and quantum computing to predict protest‑related risks for
businesses. Prior to my doctoral studies, I co‑founded two social impact initiatives for youth empowerment, one based in Montreal that advocates for youth inclusion in the design of smart cities, and the other based in Istanbul that mobilizes more than 30 stakeholder organizations in six countries across the MENA
region to foster youth employment. 

I’m a non‑resident fellow at Massey College.
