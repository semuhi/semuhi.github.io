<summary> Course description: </summary>
This course aims to provide an overview of critical conversations about the political economy of financial crises. Following an introduction to the history of global economic crises and macroeconomic fundamentals, the course will first investigate the political implications and social costs of austerity programs. What are the electoral costs of austerity measures? Who supports austerity programs and why? How do austerity measures impact political behavior and preferences for redistribution? Do they lead to increasing support for leftist or anti-mainstream parties? Then, we will discuss the international ramifications of economic crises: Do they lead to autocratization? Is the global monetary order crumbling? The primary learning outcome of this course is to expose students to timely and critical conversations about the political impact of financial crises and austerity measures at the domestic and international levels.
