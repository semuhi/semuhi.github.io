## Abstract 

How do opposition parties achieve depolarization against populist autocratic incumbents? Which depolarization strategies are effective? We examine the impact of opposition partiesâ€™ cross-partisan post-disaster relief aid on polarization and whether government counterpropaganda mitigates its impact. To that aim, we are conducting in-person survey experiments in Turkey. This highly polarized country recently went through natural disasters, including floods and wildfires. By randomizing the partisan identity of the aid recipients, our study aims to measure the heterogenous treatment effects of depolarization strategies on different partisan groups in the context of an electoral autocracy.
