Why do autocrats target one group of the elite under an economic crisis rather than others for financial repression? <details> <summary>Read more:</summary>
Under protracted economic crises, authoritarian co-optative systems often become untenable. Economic crises put constraints on available resources and the range of policy options at the regime’s disposal. As a response, if autocrats lack access to other natural resources, they must ramp up repression and reduce the winning coalition’s size. In other words, under economic constraints, autocrats do not just represent opponents but also coerce allies and purge them out of the power-sharing arrangements. This shift in gears, however, is not of choice but necessity. Under resource constraints, an autocrat must prioritize one group of close allies over the others to keep the support coalition intact. Yet, we still know very little about *who exactly* autocrats decide to kick out from the ruling coalition and target with repression under resource constraints. This is the gap my dissertation aims to fill. 

First, I argue that under resource constraints, autocrats’ hands may be tied regarding whom they can sideline from the ruling coalition. Their political economies may structurally determine the menu of options available. The targeting decisions of repression are contingent on the regime's economic growth strategy and the type of economic crisis that the country is going through. That is why the economic sector that a business elite operates in and their firm's characteristics determine whether they will get financially coerced or not. Beyond perceptions of threat and loyalty, there are certain political economy considerations at play.

Secondly, autocrats employ polarization in tandem with repression of the business elite to justify their policies by tapping into anti-business public sentiment. Public support is a key mechanism here because elite purges and repression are often coupled with legitimation efforts around these coercive acts to hedge against a potential elite dissent. Because the co-opted business elite is often perceived as corrupt by the masses, marked by easened bureaucratic regulations, preferential treatments, and lucrative public contracts, autocrats exploit polarized environments to quickly stigmatize an in-group member of the business elite working in a co-opted industry and blame them for pressing economic problems. That means autocrats may find it easier to enlist public support for ousting previously co-opted allies in politicized and co-opted sectors with a long history of receiving public bids. Polarization is a useful tool of political technology, especially in times of dwindling resources, since it provides maneuvering room for the autocrat to calibrate the existing ruling coalition and justifies expropriation and economic coercion.
