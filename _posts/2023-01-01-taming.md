## Abstract 
How do autocrats politically control the key elite groups under financial stress? I argue that autocrats leverage polarization as a political technology to manufacture public support and legitimacy for repression against key social groups to prevent their defection during times of crisis. First, using V-Dem data, I show that a higher political polarization leads to less likelihood of business opposition to autocrats. Secondly, to examine the determinants of public support for repression, I conducted a visual conjoint experiment in Turkey with fake Linkedin profiles of the business elite. The results indicate that regardless of partisan identity, the repression of co-opted business elite is more likely to be supported by the public.
