I'm a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the University of Toronto. I'm originally from Turkey. 

My dissertation research is on the authoritarian political control of the business elite through repression and cooptation. I'm also interested in how autocrats use polarization as an electoral strategy. I employ quantitative, computational, and experimental methods for my academic research. My co-authored papers are published on high-impact academic journals such as <a href="https://jcp.gc.cuny.edu"> Comparative Politics </a> and [Sociological Methods & Research](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/smr). 

I'm the co‑founder of a Toronto‑based political risk consultancy company that leverages big data to predict protest‑related risks for
businesses. Before my doctoral studies, I co‑founded two social impact initiatives for youth empowerment. One based in Montreal advocated for youth inclusion in the design of smart cities. The other, based in Istanbul, mobilized more than 30 stakeholder organizations in six countries across the MENA region to foster youth employment in the region. 

I'm a non‑resident fellow at Massey College.

I'm a competitive cook. You may also find me occasionally singing at open-mic events.
