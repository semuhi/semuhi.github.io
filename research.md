<span style="font-size: 20px; "> Why do autocrats target one group of the elite under an economic crisis rather than others for financial repression? </span> 

<details> <summary>Read more:</summary>
Under protracted economic crises, authoritarian co-optative systems often become untenable. Economic crises put constraints on available resources and the range of policy options at the regime’s disposal. As a response, if autocrats lack access to other natural resources, they must ramp up repression and reduce the winning coalition’s size. In other words, under economic constraints, autocrats do not just repress opponents but also coerce allies and purge them out of the power-sharing arrangements. This shift in gears, however, is not of choice but necessity. Under resource constraints, an autocrat must prioritize one group of close allies over the others to keep the support coalition intact. Yet, we still know very little about <i>who exactly</i> autocrats decide to kick out from the ruling coalition and target with repression under resource constraints. This is the gap my dissertation aims to fill. <br>
  <br> 
  
First, I argue that under resource constraints, autocrats’ hands may be tied regarding whom they can sideline from the ruling coalition. Their political economies may structurally determine the menu of options available. The targeting decisions of repression are contingent on the regime's economic growth strategy and the type of economic crisis that the country is going through. That is why the economic sector that a business elite operates in and their firm's characteristics shape a dictator's decisions on financial coercion. In other words, beyond perceptions of threat and loyalty, there are certain political economy considerations at play. <br>
  <br>

Secondly, autocrats employ polarization in tandem with repression of the business elite to justify their policies by tapping into anti-business public sentiment. Public support is a key mechanism here because elite purges and repression are often coupled with legitimation efforts around these coercive acts to hedge against a potential elite dissent. Because the co-opted business elite is often perceived as corrupt by the masses, marked by easened bureaucratic regulations, preferential treatments, and lucrative public contracts, autocrats exploit polarized environments to quickly stigmatize an in-group member of the business elite working in a co-opted industry and blame them for pressing economic problems. That means autocrats may find it easier to enlist public support for ousting previously co-opted allies in politicized and co-opted sectors with a long history of receiving public bids. Polarization is a useful tool of political technology, especially in times of dwindling resources, since it provides maneuvering room for the autocrat to calibrate the existing ruling coalition and justify expropriation and economic coercion.

<details> <summary>Abstract:</summary> How did COVID-19 related movement restrictions impact sentiment toward refugees? Existing theories offer conflicting answers. On the one hand, contact theories suggest that movement restrictions might reduce casual interactions with refugees, leading to less negative sentiments. On the other hand, integrated threat theories suggest refugees may be perceived as a security threat and blamed for these movement restrictions in the first place. To gauge the effect of movement restrictions, we investigate the effect of physical isolation on sentiments toward refugees in Turkey by using a novel dataset. We use Google Mobility Reports’ measurements of movement and our measures of sentiments toward refugees using refugee-related tweets from Turkey. Statistical analysis shows that xenophobic sentiment generally decreased during the pandemic. Our study shows that different types of reduced mobility correlate with increased sympathy toward refugees: the more people stay at home, the more positive sentiments toward refugees they exhibit on Twitter. We conclude by proposing two possible causal mechanisms for these findings. The findings suggest that the absence of casual contact with refugees may yield less negative sentiment, and/or that a rally around the flag mechanism yields unprecedented levels of social solidarity in response to the pandemic.

<details> <summary>Abstract:</summary> How can we measure the resource mobilization (RM) efforts of social movements on Twitter? In this article, we create the first-ever measure of social movements’ RM efforts on a social media platform. To this aim, we create a four-conditional lexicon that can parse through tweets and identify those concerned with RM. We also create a simple RM score that can be plotted in a time series format to track the RM efforts of social movements in real-time. We use our tools with millions of tweets from the United States streamed between November 28, 2018, and February 11, 2019, to demonstrate how our measure can help us estimate the saliency and persistency of social movements’ RM efforts. We find that our measure captures RM by successfully cross-checking the variation of this score against protest events in the United States during the same time frame. Finally, we illustrate the descriptive and qualitative utility of our tools for understanding social movements by running conventional topic modeling algorithms on the tweets that were used to compute the RM score and point at specific avenues for theory building and testing. </details>

<details> <summary>Abstract:</summary> Why do states target some civilians with collective punishment while coopting others with material goods during an ethnic civil war? This article examines how the Turkish government calibrated its repression and cooptation policies towards the Kurdish population during the counterinsurgency of the 1990s. In contrast to the situational conflict dynamics emphasized by the civil war literature, we explain the distribution of cooptation and repression with the state's identity policy: government policies were more punitive in areas that displayed strong Kurdish linguistic/political identity, or high tribal concentration, while they were more cooptative where the government had fostered a Sunni-Muslim Kurdish identity. The study is based on a novel dataset that includes information about displacement, tribal concentration, and violent events from archival sources. </details>

(2023) **[Taming the paper tiger? Public support for the repression of the business elite](https://osf.io/zqcyt)**. 
<details> <summary>Abstract:</summary> Why do autocrats financially repress some allies during an economic crisis? An autocrat may purge his allies when too many foxes are in the henhouse. However, it is a risky enterprise that may backfire and trigger coups and defection. I argue that his business allies, lacking public popularity, are politically expedient targets for an autocrat. I focus on Turkey as a case – a highly polarized, competitive authoritarian regime that has experienced a protracted financial crisis. I created visual conjoints with fake LinkedIn profiles of businesspeople and measured people’s support for their financial repression, varying cues of co-optation and their firm’s characteristics. The results indicate that people are more likely to condone the extra-taxation of the co-opted business elite, who owe their success to the regime and are perceived as responsible for the economic crisis. This paper contributes to a growing scholarship on micro-level determinants of autocratic purges.</details>

<details> <summary>Abstract:</summary> How does polarization at home shape social network formation and political tolerance among immigrants? The existing scholarship suggests that networks with co-nationals in the country of destination can potentially provide a ‘haven’ for newcomers and facilitate their search for jobs, accommodation, and social connections. However, the impact of polarization in the home country on these everyday interactions between immigrants is understudied. We conducted survey experiments using a novel visual treatment of fake Facebook profiles. Our results indicate that home country polarization between regime supporters and opponents travels abroad. Under high polarization in the home country, anti-government immigrants are significantly less likely to help and socially engage with government-supporting co-nationals and tolerate political activities in the host country. However, despite high political polarization at home between anti-government groups, this divisiveness disappears abroad, as they are as likely to support, politically tolerate, and socially engage with each other. The findings offer insight into the mechanisms through which polarization at home can diffuse abroad and how contextual factors can mitigate affective polarization. </details>

(2024) **[Climate disasters exacerbate polarization: Could cross-partisan outreach help?](https://egap.org/project/does-every-cloud-have-a-silver-lining-disasters-and-polarization/)** (with Michael Donnelly). 
<details> <summary>Abstract:</summary> Do climate disasters exacerbate polarization? We present the results of a statistical analysis based on two country-level datasets that wildfires and exposure to floods as climate disasters fuel political polarization. If that is the case, how can opposition parties achieve depolarization against populist autocratic incumbents post-disaster? One such depolarization strategy is the post-disaster relief aid distributed by opposition-controlled metropolitan municipalities to pro-government provinces hit by destructive floods. To test its effects on political tolerance and affective polarization, we conducted an in-person survey experiment with a sample of the Turkish population – a country that experienced democratic backsliding, suffers from an ethnic conflict, and has the highest level of affective polarization globally. Our findings show that in response to natural disasters, costly public acts can increase political tolerance of out-party members. However, they backfire in terms of affective polarization, and make it more likely for the opposition supporters to be conceived in negative terms like hypocrite. We show that depolarization strategies may have divergent effects on affective polarization and political tolerance, even though they are closely intertwined. The external validity of common tactics of depolarization discussed in the U.S. context should be empirically tested, especially in countries with intense government propaganda that deploys polarization as a political technology. </details>

(2024) **Tax audit as authoritarian repression during sovereign debt crises.** 
<details> <summary>Abstract:</summary> Why do autocratic regimes target certain firms with financial repression during economic crises? While the financial extortion of businesses may return quick rents during downturns, such coercion in the middle of a crisis may also backfire with defection and reputational costs. Therefore, the regime would strategically calibrate who to target with which tool of coercion. I argue that co-optation is a poisonous pill: co-opted businesses present a politically expedient target during economic crises. To that aim, autocrats deploy tax audits against these companies as a covert and technical tool of financial repression. I test these ideas using firm-level data from over 32000 companies in 40 electoral autocracies. The findings show that even though tax audits are less likely during sovereign debt crises, that is not true for firms that have secured a public contract. They are more likely and more frequently to be inspected by the tax authorities, and even more so during debt crises. The results have significant implications for state-business relations under autocratic regimes. </details>

(2024) **Autocrats and their business allies: The informal politics of defection and co-optation.**
<details> <summary>Abstract:</summary> Why do (not) business allies defect from authoritarian regimes? An emerging schol- arship shows that connected businesses face high political risk, and the autocrat can shake down his business allies during a major economic crisis. And yet, despite their structural and disruptive power, the business elite rarely switches to opposition. I ar- gue that this unusual loyalty does not always stem from credible power-sharing. The more material quid pro quo the business elite engages with the dictator, the less they can credibly threaten him with defection. I present a bargaining game between the dictator and his business allies and test these ideas using a country-year-level dataset of 76 countries for the time period 1992-2019. The results indicate that higher degrees of patrimonial co-optation and sovereign debt crises lower the risk of business oppo- sition to the regime. These findings have implications for our understanding of elite defection that even informal, non-institutional tools of co-optation can effectively deter defection. </details>

<details> <summary>Abstract:</summary> Why does the business elite defect? On the one hand, it’s a risky enterprise to challenge an autocratic incumbent, as the threat of expropriation, imprisonment, or any other type of repression is real. On the other hand, the business elite sometimes does defect from autocratic regimes and in some cases, even spearheads the social mobilization against them. What determines this variation? Using the V-DEM data, I analyze the determinants of business opposition to autocratic regimes. </details>
